# Fartlek run generator
This creates a randomized Fartlek run (suitable when you don't have a running partner).

A Fartlek run is one typically done with two or more people where each person
will take turns choosing how far and fast they are to run, e.g. "sprint to
the next tree" or "job until the end of the block."

USER INPUTS: minimum interval length, maximum interval length, and run length

OUTPUTS: Randomized interval lengths and paces.
